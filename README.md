# crisper-ko-showcase
Showcase of my old framework (2016 year).

During my tenure as a developer at an outsourcing company, I developed a frontend framework from scratch. This framework, which was heavily influenced by Java's Spring Framework, was later used in numerous company projects. Interestingly, it bears resemblance to Angular 2, even though Angular 2 did not exist at that time.
